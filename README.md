## Modern Java Technologies 2023/24 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for weekly exercises from the Modern Java Technologies course, held during the academic year 2023/24 at Sofia University.

The course covers various advanced Java topics, and each week's exercise focuses on different aspects of modern Java development, including streams, concurrency, generics, lambdas, and more.

## Note

I was not officially enrolled in the Modern Java Technologies course during the semester when it was held in the academic year 2023/24 at Sofia University. I am currently going through the course independently by watching the recorded lectures and lab sessions. This repository contains my solutions to the weekly exercises as I follow along with the course material.
